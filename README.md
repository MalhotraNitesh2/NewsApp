# NewsApp

NewsApp is a simple and clean iOS app that displays the latest headlines along with article descriptions and images. The app fetches news from a live API and presents it in a scrollable table view.

You can tap any news item to open the full article directly in Safari.

## How it works

* The app fetches news data (title, description, image URL) from a news API.
* News is displayed using `UITableView` with a custom cell for image + text.
* Clicking on any cell opens Safari with the article‚Äôs full link.
* The app handles missing images or descriptions gracefully (e.g. shows a placeholder image or "No description").
